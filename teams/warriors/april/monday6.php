//What is a variable?
/*
 * Variables are data values that can change when the user is
 * asked a question, for example, their age. ...
 * The memory location is used to hold data.
 * The key difference when comparing a constant to a variable
 * is that the value associated with a variable name may change
 * during program execution.

computer program. They also provide a way of $label ing data with a descriptive name, 
so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves.
 It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. 
 Their sole purpose is to $label and store data in memory. 
 This data can then be used throughout your program.";
